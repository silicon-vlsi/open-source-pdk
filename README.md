# IHP Open PDK 130nm BiCMOS
130nm BiCMOS Open Source PDK, dedicated for Analog/Digital, Mixed Signal and RF Design. IHP Open Source PDK project goal is to provide a fully open source Process Design Kit and related data, which can be used to create manufacturable designs at IHPâ€™s facility. As of March 2023, this repository is targeting the SG13G2 process node.
